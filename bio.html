    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am an aspiring data scientist driven by a passion for leveraging data to empower creators and entrepreneurs in the digital space. 
      Currently learning and honing my skills at ALX, I am building a strong foundation in Python, data visualization and practical data analysis to tackle real-world challenges.
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes me unique is my commitment to digital inclusion. I strive to create tools that amplify under-represented voices in social media, travel and entertainment industries.

    <p>
      My work is fueled by a vision to bridge creativity and technology through data, enabling accessible and meaningful digital growth for all. 
      By combining technical expertise with a purpose-driven approach, I aim to contribute solutions that not only advance innovation but also foster equity and opportunity in the evolving digital landscape.
