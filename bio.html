    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I’m an aspiring data scientist with a strong foundation in Python, data visualization, and applied analytics — currently sharpening my skills through the ALX Data Science program. 
      I’m passionate about using data to solve meaningful problems and support inclusive, technology-driven growth across diverse industries.
    </p>

    <p>
      What sets me apart is my commitment to digital inclusion and purpose-driven innovation. I’m especially interested in building data solutions that empower underserved communities 
      and drive equity in areas like access to information, economic development, and decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      By combining technical skills with a values-first approach, I aim to contribute to projects that not only deliver insights but also make a measurable, positive impact on society.
