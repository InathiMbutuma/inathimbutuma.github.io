      <h2>Written Version</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Inathi Mbutuma, a focused and driven learner currently enrolled in the ALX Data Science program, one of the most rigorous and fast-paced tech programs on the continent.</p>
      <p>While I’m still early in my journey and haven’t built formal projects yet, I’ve fully committed to mastering data science through disciplined, structured learning. I leverage tools like Notion for tracking progress, Anki for long-term retention of complex concepts, and I study daily with a clear plan for continuous improvement.</p>
      <p>The ALX program pushes me to think analytically, solve problems independently, and collaborate in demanding environments, all of which I embrace. I bring a strong work ethic, fast-learning ability, and a growth mindset that prepares me to contribute real value from day one.</p>
      <p>I’m eager to join a forward-thinking team where I can apply what I’m learning and grow into a high-impact data professional.</p>
